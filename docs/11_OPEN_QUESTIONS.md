# Open Questions

Each question includes a proposed experiment/prototype and success criteria.

## Q-001 - Square peg onboarding load
- Question: Will users accept learning 16 pegs before opening training feels useful?
- Proposed experiment: 5-minute onboarding prototype with Level 1 micro-lesson and first recall check.
- Success criteria: >=70% of new users complete Level 1 micro-lesson and proceed to a PGN seed import.

## Q-002 - Best default encoding pack
- Question: Which pack (animals+props vs fantasy vs geometric) minimizes confusion?
- Proposed experiment: A/B test two packs in Level 1 and track confusion pairs (e4/e5, g7/g8).
- Success criteria: 15% lower confusion error rate for the winning pack.

## Q-003 - Locus granularity
- Question: One full move per locus vs one ply per locus for beginners.
- Proposed experiment: A/B test in a controlled seed slice (12 plies) with two cohorts.
- Success criteria: Equal or better 7-day retention with the one-locus-per-full-move cohort.

## Q-004 - Branching UX comprehension
- Question: Are door-signpost branch cues understandable without prior mnemonic experience?
- Proposed experiment: Prototype two UIs (doors in palace vs separate variation palaces) and run a 10-minute usability test.
- Success criteria: 80% of participants can pick the correct branch after a deviation prompt.

## Q-005 - Error repair loop friction
- Question: Does mandatory repair loop reduce session completion?
- Proposed experiment: A/B test mandatory vs optional repair loop with identical review queues.
- Success criteria: No more than 5% drop in session completion in mandatory condition, with improved next-attempt accuracy.

## Q-006 - Timing thresholds for mastery
- Question: What response time thresholds feel fair across skill levels?
- Proposed experiment: Collect response time distributions for Level 1-3 and set thresholds at median + 1 SD.
- Success criteria: >=85% of users pass timing gates without manual overrides.

## Q-007 - Tone tiers selection UX
- Question: Can users select tone tiers without confusion about allowed content?
- Proposed experiment: Add a tone preview row with examples and measure changes in tier selection errors.
- Success criteria: <5% of users report confusion about content limits.

## Q-008 - Transposition drill comprehension
- Question: Do users understand why the same position is tested via different routes?
- Proposed experiment: Show transposition prompts with a short explanation badge and track correctness and feedback ratings.
- Success criteria: >=80% correctness and neutral-or-better feedback ratings.
